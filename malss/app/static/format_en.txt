The input data need to be a csv file with the format shown below.<br>
Each column represents each <font color="#1E90FF"><strong>feature</strong></font> (variable to be used for prediction) or <font color="#1E90FF"><strong>target</strong></font> (variable to be predicted).<br>
The first row represents the names of the columns (features and target) (i.e. header).<br>
Values such as NaN, NA, N/A, NULL, null, and nan are handled as missing values.
