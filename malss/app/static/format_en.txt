The input data need to be a csv file with the format shown below.
Each column represents each feature (variable to be used for prediction) or target (variable to be predicted).
The first row represents the names of the columns (features and target) (i.e. header).
Values such as NaN, NA, N/A, NULL, null, and nan are handled as missing values.
