MALSS interactive supports <font color="#1E90FF"><strong>supervised learning</strong></font>.<br>
Supervised learning is the learning method that learns the model for predicting unseen data from existing data.<br>
Existing data consists of explanatory variables (<font color="#1E90FF"><strong>features</strong></font>) and <font color="#1E90FF"><strong>target variable</strong></font>.<br>
Features are variables used for predicting the target variable.<br>
(Machine learning with only features (without target variable) is called <font color="#1E90FF"><strong>unspervised learning</strong></font>.)
