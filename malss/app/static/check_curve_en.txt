Check the learning curves below, and confirm the state (high bias or high variance) of each algorithm.<br>
The score of the learning curves represents F-measure (classification task) or negative mean squared error (regression task).<br>
High score means the performance of the model (algorithm) is high.<br>
<br>
If a model tends <strong>to be high variance, feature selection would help</strong> to get better results.<br>
MALSS interactive supports feature selection.<br>
If you want to try feature selection, press "Try feature selection".
If not, press "Continue".
