Getting more data would help to avoid overfitting.
And some machine learning algorithms have hyper parameters that is effective for avoiding overfitting.

So, how we can check whether the model is overfitted or not?
We want to estimate the performance of the model for unknown data.
To estimate that, cross validation method is commonly used.
In the cross validation, the data is partitioned into k equal sized subset of the data.
Of the k subsets, a single subset is retained as the validation set for testing the model, and the remaining k-1 subsets are used for training the model.
This process is repeated k times, with each of the k subsets used exactly once as the validation data.
Finally, the averaged value of the k results is used as the estimated score for unknown data.
This is called k-fold cross validation.
